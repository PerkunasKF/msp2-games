    - On mouse cursor hover mouse cursor changes to indicate icon is interactive. 
    - On click a box with all instructions and features pop up in the middle of the screen.

4. As a player I am looking for a track of my achievements in the game:
    - Clicking high score button pops up a high score board for classic and extreme game modes. 
    - On achieving high enough score player gets to write down their name or nickname. 
    - The high score is saved on their browser so they can always see their high achievement.
